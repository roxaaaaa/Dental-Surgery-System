# Dental-Surgery-System

The project involves the development of a Dentist Booking System, designed to carry out and manage the process of booking appointments for dental patients. This system will assist the two main actors of the system: the Receptionists and Dentists. We aim to provide an easy-to-use interface for booking dental treatments, scheduling, and managing patient details. 
 
The project will be developed using Java and potentially a GUI (Graphical User Interface). A web-based application was initially considered, but the focus is on creating a desktop application to begin with. This solution will make the system accessible for receptionists to manage appointments efficiently. The potential creation of a GUI will provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface, improving the interaction for users within the clinic environment. 

During the development of this system, the team will acquire and enhance the following skills: 

Technical Skills: 

Java Programming: Enhancing our knowledge of Java and its capabilities for building functional and efficient applications. 

Database Design: Gaining experience in using MySQL for backend database management to store and retrieve patient details, appointments, and schedules as well as exploring CRUD operations as we put them to practice. 

GUI Development (Optional): If decided to implement a GUI, we will develop expertise in designing user interfaces using Java libraries such as Swing or JavaFX. 

General Skills: 

Team Collaboration: Strengthening our ability to work together as a team, dividing tasks, and managing project timelines. 

Problem-Solving: Applying problem-solving techniques to address real-world issues such as appointment conflicts, treatment scheduling, and patient management. 

Business Knowledge: Understanding how to align the system's design with business needs, including improving customer service and operational efficiency in a dental clinic. 

The system will provide the following core functionalities: 
 Patient Registration and Management: Allows receptionists to register new patients and maintain their details. 
 Treatment Selection: Receptionists will present the patient with a list of available treatments, and the patient can select the treatment they need. 
 Appointment Scheduling: Receptionists will present available time slots for the chosen dentist and treatment. The patient will select an available time, and the appointment will be booked. 
Dentist Selection: Based on the selected time, the system will display available dentists, and the patient will choose a dentist. 
 Schedule Management: The system will allow dentists to update their availability, preventing double-booking.
Patient and Appointment Management: Receptionists can view patient details, check appointment history, and modify or cancel appointments as needed. 

Use Case Priorities: 

-  Primary: Register Patient, Select Treatment, Book Appointment, View Schedule. 

-  Secondary: Update Appointment, Cancel Appointment.
